# QuPath BIOP Extension

This repo adds some tools developed at the BIOP to ease scripting and assist user project in Qupath

## Installing

Download the latest `qupath-extension-biop-[version].jar` file
from [releases](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-biop/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory. The extension will
then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).
