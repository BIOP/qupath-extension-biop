## Installing
### On QuPath 0.6.x

- Install and setup the [qupath-biop-catalog](https://github.com/BIOP/qupath-biop-catalog) first.
- Open the Extension Manager `Extension -> Manage extensions`
- Follow steps described in the [official documention](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/intro/extensions.html) to browse and install/update the latest version of **QuPath BIOP** extension from the **QuPath BIOP** catalog.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If your extensions directory is unset, create a new empty folder somewhere on your computer. On QuPath, go under `Edit -> Preferences -> Extensions` and browse the empty folder you've just created.
> Extensions will then be added inside this folder.

- You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).


### On QuPath 0.5.x
Download the latest `qupath-extension-biop-[version].jar` file
from [releases](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-biop/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory. The extension will
then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).
