- Select the latest version
- Click on `Install`

> Note: If you need to update the extension, click on the ⚙️ button and select the latest version to install.


### On QuPath 0.5.x
Download the latest `qupath-extension-biop-[version].jar` file
from [releases](https://github.com/biop/qupath-extension-biop/releases) and drag it onto the main QuPath window.

If you haven't installed any extensions before, you'll be prompted to select a QuPath user directory. The extension will
then be copied to a location inside that directory.

You might then need to restart QuPath (but not your computer).
